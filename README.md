## CSS mix-blend-mode
The ```mix-blend-mode``` CSS property describes how an element's content should blend with the content of the element that is below it and the element's background.

With this project, I wanted to give an interactive way to experiment with the ```mix-blend-mode``` property.

## Controls

On the right of the screen, or below the image container depending on  screen width, you will find the controls panel. 

### Select a blend mode
The buttons at the top of the control panel allow you to dynamically change for one ```mix-blend-mode``` value to the next.

### Customize the text
The text area in the middle of the control panel allows the user to customize the text visible over top of the image.

### Select a custom color
The color selector at the bottom of the control panel allows the user to select a custom color for the text box  ```color``` property
